# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to Pedant! Just remember before you contribute, we ask that you follow Google's style guide for JavaScript.

It's actually pretty easy: just before you run `git commit` just run `clang-format -i pedant.js` first, to make the code-style consistent.

If you're running Ubuntu/Debian, you can install clang-format by `apt-get install clang-format`.

If you're on a mac and have Homebrew installed, you can run `brew install clang-format` to get it.
